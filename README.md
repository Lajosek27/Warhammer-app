# Warhammer-app

Hi ðŸ™‚ For the legal and copyrights reason, this site is only available after login and there is no register. The site is only to practice coding and to use by small group of people, my rpg friends ðŸ™‚ I strongly recommend to look on site (URL: https://whapp.pl) and check code on github. I didnâ€™t share database because, as i write before, mechanics don't belong to me. However i create 2 accounts for guests, like you ðŸ™‚ You can find login and password at the end of this file (Until i find a job).

But now i wish to write more about purpose of this site to let you understand how it works. This site is use to checking progress and management of Player's Characters in Pen&Paper game Warhammer Fantasy RPG game 4th ed. It allows you to build new PC or NPC, progressing, fast checking most important info (If you are not into RPG game, there is a lot of statistic), so you donâ€™t have to stop your session. 

From the side of code. It's database site, that allows you to manage characters assigned to your account. Progressing works, of course, on server side. After then shown on client side. To practice, i use a lot different methods to get even same result.
