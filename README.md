# Warhammer-app

Hi :) For the legal and copyrights reason, this site is only available after login and theres no register. 
All site it's only to practis coding and to use by small grupe of people, my rpg friends :) 
It's strongly recomended to look on site (URL: link) and check code on github. I didnt share database because, as i write befor, mechanics don't belng to me. 
However i create 2 accounts for guests, like you :) You can find login and password at the end of this file (Untill i find a job).


But now i wish to write more about purpose of this site to let's you understand how it's works. 
This site is use to checking progress and management of Player's Characters in Pen&Paper game Warhammer Fantasy RPG game 4 ed.
It's allow you to build new PC or NPC, progressing, fast checking most important info (If you not into RPG game, thres a lot of statistic), 
so you dont have to stops your sesions. Theres also help to player who can't progress there's PC alone, because don't know mechanics.

From the side of code. It's database site, thats allow you to management characters assigned to your's account. Progressing works, ofcourse, on server side. 
After then show on client side. To practics i use a lot different methods to get even same result.

Logn and password.
